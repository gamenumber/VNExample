MARINA
Marcus, that wasn't funny!
MARCUS
Stop being such a big crybaby, Marina! It was just a joke!
MARINA
I thought you were actually going to leave me all alone in the forest to starve!
MARCUS
No you didn't!  You're just trying to get me in trouble with Mama!
MARINA
Did too! You're such a bully, Marcus! I hate you!
MARCUS
Marina, you know I would never leave you in that forest!
MARINA
You promise?
MARCUS
I promise.  So don't tell Mama, okay?
MARINA
You promise?
MARCUS
Huh?  I just said I--
MARINA
You promised, Marcus.
PILOT
Hey, kid!  We're almost there so I gotta cut your beauty sleep short.
MARCUS
*What?  Where am I?  Marina...*
MARCUS
*Oh, right.*
MARCUS
Right... Sorry, I didn't mean to doze off.
PILOT
Ah, it's all the same to me. Probably for the best that you catch some shut eye before meeting your new teammates.  From my understanding, they're planning on putting you to work right away.
MARCUS
That's good, at least. Wouldn't want to come all the way to Antarctica just to stand by in the sidelines.
PILOT
No, I don't suppose you would, would you?
PILOT
So, are you from Oxford like  Dr. Adams's and the other grad students?
MARCUS
No. I'm from Miskatonic University in Arkham.
MARCUS
*I'm not surprised when the helicopter becomes silent. Mentioning Miskatonic University in Antarctica is like mentioning the Titanic on a cruise ship.*
PILOT
Ah.  I don't suppose anyone from Miskatonic has been down here since--
MARCUS
William Dyer.
PILOT
Right.  Well, uh, just because the one guy's a bit of a loon doesn't mean that you all are.
MARCUS
...Yeah.
MARCUS
*I stiffen a bit. That kind of reaction.  That's exactly why I'm coming to Antarctica. To undo that association.  
MARCUS
It was poison when trying to apply to PhD programs and post-graduate jobs.  I swear, the minute they make it to the education section, my CV goes in the shredder.
MARCUS
But more than that, I just can't stand the looks people give me when they find out.  No matter how hard I try not to see them, I feel them boring into the back of my head.
MARCUS
Just because Marina could ignore them doesn't mean I can.*
PILOT
Well, would you look at that, here we are!
PILOT
Kinda cute, isn't it?
MARCUS
It almost looks like it would get blown over in a bad snowstorm
PILOT
Not to worry, I hear it's plenty sturdy.  Not to mention this certainly isn't the season for blizzards.
MARCUS
Well, thank you very much for getting me out here.
MARCUS
*Even if you kind of insulted me along the way.*
PILOT
Hey, kid.
MARCUS
Yes?
PILOT
I know you probably know this as much as I do but...  Some academics can get a little stuffy about where you're from and all... School-wise, I mean.  And so, you know, Miskatonic's past considered--
MARCUS
Just prove 'em wrong, right?
PILOT
Yeah, that's the spirit kid.  Let's getcha down there so you can prove 'em wrong.
MARCUS
*I kind of appreciate that pep talk, odd as it was.*
