DAIYU
Marcus, can you take pictures?
MARCUS
Oh, yeah, sure.
NICK
Need the tallest to grab the sample?
MARCUS
*Daiyu doesn't say anything, but wordlessly motions for Nick to stand under the stalactite of interest.  He beams, apparently happy to have his superior stature acknowledged.*
DAIYU
Boost me.
NICK
What... Oh, fine.
MARCUS
*He seems disappointed that he doesn't get to collect the sample himself. I try not to let my smile myself. Meanwhile, Dr. Adams has been swabbing a test tube.  He hands it to Daiyu.*
DR. ADAMS
A test tube for my lady.
DAIYU
...Thanks.
MARCUS
*In one swift motion, as though they'd somehow rehearsed it, Daiyu steps into Nick's interlocked fingers and he lifts her up.  For a moment, she looks like she's hovering in midair, her leg extended back like a ballet arabesque. She scoops up a portion of the black-green substance into the test tube and gracefully descends back into Nick's grip.*
MARCUS
This can't be regulation.
DAIYU
The ladder is heavy and annoying.
MARCUS
*At Dr. Adams' behest, we go into the cave a bit deeper but find nothing else of note.  In all fairness, I think we all have blinders on: none of us can think of anything more exciting than going back to the lab and putting our names to whatever it is we've discovered here.*
