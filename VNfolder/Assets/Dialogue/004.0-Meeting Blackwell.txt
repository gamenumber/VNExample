Woo, that's a lot steamier!
DR. ADAMS
Yes, the Antarctic cold is a lot to adjust to!  Marcus, how are you holding up?
MARCUS
Just fine, Doctor.  That's just a light breeze in New England.
DR. ADAMS
Right you are! Well, then Daiyu's collected us a few samples here.  Let's get you situated with your team lead, shall we Marcus?
MARCUS
Team lead?
DR. ADAMS
Yes!  You'll be coming out doing field work with myself and the other two of course, but here in the lab, that is to say, most of the time, you'll be reporting to Professor Blackwell.
MARCUS
Uh-
MARCUS
*Before I could voice an opinion, a stern-looking woman who towered over nearly everyone walked in.  The door slammed behind her with finality.*
DR. ADAMS
Ah, speak of the devil!  Marcus, this is Professor Blackwell of Yale.
"PROFESSOR" BLACKWELL
It's doctor, actually.
DR. ADAMS
Ah yes!  I always forget that, don't I?
DR. BLACKWELL
Yes, you do.
DR. ADAMS
And -Doctor- Blackwell, this is Marcus Rodriguez.  Marcus, would you mind catching Dr. Blackwell up to speed?
MARCUS
*I explain the circumstances under which we found our sample, but the entire time she doesn't seem to be listening at all. Her eyes seem to be scouring every inch of me, scrutinizing, looking for some deficiency or weakness.  I start talking faster so that I can end this exchange.*
MARCUS
...And that's about it.
DR. BLACKWELL
...
DR. BLACKWELL
Dr. Adams.
DR. ADAMS
Yes?
MARCUS
*She didn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her.*
DR. BLACKWELL
You really let a student collect a sample in such a haphazard manner?  Not to mention it's could very well be the sample that keeps our door open or shuts us down?
DR. ADAMS
Come on, Marie, Daiyu was extremely careful.
DR. BLACKWELL
Even if she was, you still- Doctor Adams!
MARCUS
*He's already walked away from her. She turns her attention towards me*
DR. BLACKWELL
Hey, you.
MARCUS
Yes, Dr. Blackwell.
DR. BLACKWELL
Please stand there and, just don't touch anything.
MARCUS
Are you sure?  It wouldn't be much trouble for me to prep the sample.
DR. BLACKWELL
No, I don't know what you're trained on, and I can't have anything happening to one of the only interesting samples we've retrieved because someone from-
MARCUS
*She caught herself before finishing her sentence, but we both knew where that was going*
DR. BLACKWELL
Anyway, just don't touch anything.
MARCUS
*And then she went marching after Dr. Adams.*
MARCUS
*...*
MARCUS
*It really looks like she'll be gone for a while...*
