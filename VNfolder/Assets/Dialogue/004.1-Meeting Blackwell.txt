There's no point in clashing with my boss on the first day, even if she does seem difficult.  Maybe even because she seems difficult.
MARCUS
It's best to just wait here.
DR. BLACKWELL
Ah, sorry that took so long. Good to see you can at least follow directions.
DR. BLACKWELL
That can't exactly be said about everyone here.
DR. BLACKWELL
Alright, to get samples in and out of storage and to get access to a lot of chemicals, you're going to need badge access. You've been outfitted, correct?
MARCUS
Uh, not yet, ma'am.
DR. BLACKWELL
Really?  That Adams...
DR. BLACKWELL
Can't be helped.  Mr. Chambers, the interim administrator, is probably in the computer lab this time of day.  Why don't you see if you can catch up with him and get yourself properly checked in.
MARCUS
Can do.
