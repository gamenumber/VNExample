MARCUS
There's no reason for me to just sit around.  I know what I'm doing.
DR. BLACKWELL
Sorry that took so long- 
DR. BLACKWELL
Wait, what are you doing?
MARCUS
I'm setting up the sample. You can feel free to check my work.  I assure you I haven't made any mistakes.
DR. BLACKWELL
That is completely besides the point!  I told you exactly what to do and you-
DR. ADAMS
What seems to be the problem here?
DR. BLACKWELL
Charles, I swear, if you are going to keep bringing people in here who deliberately ignore procedure-
DR. ADAMS
Oh, Marie, don't worry, I'm sure Marcus here didn't cause any harm.
DR. BLACKWELL
I certainly hope not.
DR. ADAMS
Speaking of, Marcus, we haven't gotten you a badge yet, have we?
MARCUS
No, sir.
DR. ADAMS
We'd better get you down to the administration office then. Ah, actually Kenneth will be in the computer lab about this time of day. 
DR. ADAMS
Marie, how did Marcus do, setting up that sample?
DR. BLACKWELL
It's fine.  He did it right.
DR. ADAMS
Good!  Then there will be no problems like this in the future I'm sure.  Go ahead then, Marcus. Ask for a Mr. Chambers in the lab. Get you badge and see you at supper.
